Overview:

Each type of compilation runs inside it's own docker container.
Each container can have it's src and dist targets configured.
Each container will have it's own package.json (yarn!)


Containers:

 - JSX
 - ES6
 - Sass / postcss
 - Sprite sheet
 - SVG
 - Static Site generator (eg metalsmith)

 - Code analysis
