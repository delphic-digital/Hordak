Goals:

 - pull deps with yarn & lock them down for a project
 - compile with webpack (ES6 / JSX / ES5 / Sass -> postcss -> css)
 - Handle SVGs somehow - different projects may need different solutions for loading SVGs.
 - simple configuration for build targets (seperate for css / js / SVG / ... markup?)
 - Set up within a docker container in a way that doesn't require mind warping

Nice to haves:

 - sass linting
 - ES6 linting
 - JSX linting
 - Code analysis
